This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting fraudulent activity in financial transactions. The goal is to use historical transaction data to train a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. The project will involve preprocessing and cleaning the data, selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, training and evaluating the model, and implementing the model in a scalable and production-ready environment
the data and preprocessing steps, the machine learning models used, the evaluation metrics, and the results obtained. The project will also include instructions on how to replicate the results and use the model for fraud detection in other financial transactions. The final goal of this project is to provide a usable and efficient solution for detecting fraudulent activity, which can help organizations reduce their losses from fraud and increase customer trust.
